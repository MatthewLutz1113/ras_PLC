\section{Conceptual Development}

Several ideas were bounced around as to how to launch the ball. A catapult-style launcher was completely ruled out since the moving parts required to hit the ball at 40 mph would be quite hazardous with numerous pinch and crush points. Thus, it was decided to design a launcher with dual opposite-direction wheels which shoot the ball out, similar to a tennis ball launcher.
