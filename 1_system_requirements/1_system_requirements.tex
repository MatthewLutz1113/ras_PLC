\section{Design Requirments}

\subsection{Immediate Priorities}

Use PLC ladder logic as a fundamental part of th design, using a program such as OpenPLC on the Arduino. Slide open and close the blinds and rotate open and close using the existing hardware via time of day or button input. Open and close the screen door, allowing for a ``neutral'' mode during waking hours using simple button input and time of day commmands.

\subsection{Secondary Priorities}

Add Homekit module as an input to the PLC, permitting the blinds to be controlled from the PLC in response to commands from Siri.
